Preparations for Session 1:
    Tests are not sufficient
    TKinter might be better to be replaced by pyqt
        Downsides: paid licence and steeper learning curve
        Upside: more reliable and native UI, better UI widgets
    Maze solving algorithm is only DFS, maybe A* better solution
    Maze creation way to slow
